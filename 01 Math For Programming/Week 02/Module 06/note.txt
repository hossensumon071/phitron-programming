POINT
    .Just a dot
    .Location only
    .No length, width, shape, size

LINE
    .Two different points
    .Connect them
    .Take the straight path
        -Also the shortest
        -
    .This is called line sagement
        -Finite length
    .Line: extended in both ends
        -Infinte length
    .Ray: extended in one end 
        -infinite length


COORDINATE SYSTEM
    .How do you navigate in real life?
        -Reference point, directions, distance etc
    .How to identify a point in space?
        -Coordinate System!
        -Remember number Line? One-dimensional coordinate System.


    .2D coordinate System
    


TRIANGLE 
    .3 points and 3 line sagements
    .Sum of three angles = 180 degree
    .Area = 1/2 * base * height
    .Based on equality between sides
        -Equilateral
        -Isosecles
        -Scalene

SQUARE 
    .4 points and 4 line sagements
    .All sides are equal
    .Each angle is 90 degree
    .Sum of four angles i 360 degree
    .Area: (side_length) SQUARE
    .length of diagonal: square 2 * (side length)


.Pythagorean theorem
    - c square = a square + b square
.Right-angle triangle and square 
.example: 
    

RECTANGLE
    .4 points and 4 line segements
    .Opposite sides are equal
    .Each angle is 90 degree
    .Sum of four angles is 360 degree
    .Area: length * height


CIRCLE
    .Center
    .Radius
    .Diameter
    .Area = pie * (radius) square 


SERIES
    .Sequense List of numbers with some order or pattern
        -1,3,5,7,9
        -1,1,2,3,5,8,13.....

    .Series: sum of elements in a sequence
        s1 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9;
        s2 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + ....

    .Finite vs Infinite series 
    .Arithmetic vs Geometric series



1+2+3+...+N = ?

s = 1+2+3+.....N
s = N + (N-1) + (N-2)+ ... + 1

(+).2s = (N + 1) + (N + 1) + (N + 1) + .... + (N + 1)
2s = N*(N+1)
s = N*(N+1) / 2


SERIES (FINITE SUM)

.Arithmetic series
    s = 2+5+8
    find the 100th number in the series
    Find the sum of first 100 numbers


.nth term Arithmetic series : a+(n-1)*d
