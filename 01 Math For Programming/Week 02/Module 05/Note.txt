.Greatest common Divisor
.Example: Find the gcd of 15 and 6
    - Divisors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15;
    - Divisor of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6;
    - Common divisors: 1, 3;
    - GCD: 3


.Simple way to find gcd(a, b)
    -Take i to be 1 to minimum(a, b)
        .Check if i divides both a and b
        .Largest such i is the gcd
    -Just like the naive method we learned for finding divisors
        .Too many unnecessary calculations

.Lets learn a clever way - The Euclidean Algorithm



.gcd(a,b) = gcd(b, a % b)
.gcd(p, 0) = gcd(0, p) = p
.example: gcd(15, 6) = gcd(6, 3) = gcd(3, 0) = 3
.changing order does not matter



LCM - Least common multiple

. Multiple 
. Common multiple Least common multiple 
. Example: Find the 1cm of 15 and 6
            - Multiples of 15: 15, 30, 45, 60
            - Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60
            - Common multiples: 30, 60
            - LCM: 30

.Simple way to find lcm(a, b)
    -Take multiples of the larger number and see if the smaller one divides it 
    - Computation heavy

.Or you may find it using gcd:
    .gcd(a,b)*lcm(a,b) = a*b
