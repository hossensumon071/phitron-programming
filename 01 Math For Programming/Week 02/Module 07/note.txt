UNITARY METHOD
.Tom finishes his homework within 15 hours while jerry takes 10 hours.how many hours will the same homework take to be done if they work together ?

idea: How is their performance per hour?
.Toms 15 hour of work === 1 homework
    -Toms 1 hour of  === 1/15 homework

.jerrys 10 hour of work === 1 homework
    -jerrys 1 hour of work === 1/10 homework 


.Tom and jerrys 1 hour of work combined === (1/15 + 1/10) homework = 1/6 homework



PERCENTAGE
.per hundred quantity
.Scaling reference to 100
.Example 
    -You gave a test on 40 marks. Your score was 32
    -what would be the score if the test was taken with 100 marks?
    -May use unitary method
        .Out of 40 your score = 32
        .Out of 1 your score = 32/40
        .out of 100 your score = (32/40) * 100 = 80
        .This is per hundred quantity, therefore, percentage
        .You got 80% marks (see how we avoid mentioning the marks!)

You may just multiply the ratio with 100% (= 100*1/100 = 1)
    . 32/40 * 100% = 80%



PERCENTAGE Problem
1. A clothing store is selling one of their most popular products at 870 tk after 40% discount. what was the original price?

.what we dont know is the original price 
.Let it be x
.the discount price = x*(100-40)% = x*60/100 = 870
.the original price 
    x = 870*100/60 = 1450


2. The price of oil increased by 25% and then decreased by 15%. what is the net percentageof increased or decreased oil price?

.we dont know the initial value 
.lets assume the initial price was 100
.increase by 25% updated price = 125
.Decreased by 15%
    -Price gets reduced to 85%
    -Updated price = 125 * 85% = 125 * 85/100 = 106.25

.Final price is more than 100 
.Net increase (106.25 - 100) = 6.25 if the original price was 100 (per hundred)
.answer: increased by 6.25%


CAPITAL AND INTEREST
    .Capital 
    .Interest
    .Interest rate
        -Per 100 taka 
        -per 1 year (3 months, 6 month are also common)
    .Simple interest vs compund interest 
    .Simple interest
        - I = P*n*r
        - interest = capital * time unit * interest rate

SIMPLE INTEREST

1 .Your friend deposits 700 tk in shonali bank for 3 years which earn him an interest of 8% what is the amount he gets after 3 years?

i=?, p = 700
     n = 3,
     r = 8%


2. You deposite 5400 tk and got back an amount of 6000 tk after 2 years. Find the simple interest rate of the bank.

I = 6000, p = 5400, n = 2, r = ?
