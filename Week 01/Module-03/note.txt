Floor - Nearest integer below
Ceiling - Nearest integer above
Round - Nearest integer

Divisor Counting
    .Problem statement: Given an integer n. How many divisors are there for n?
            .You knwo the answer if n is a prime, right?
                -Example: 3, 11, 73 etc
            .WHat about if it is not a prime number? how do yo count divisions?


Divisor Counting - Naive
    .Take all the integers (1 to n) and test if remainder is 0 
        -example: Lets take 12
        -The divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,12
        -Number of divisors: 6


Divisor Counting - Better?
    .We already know 1 and will be there!
    .so 2 to (n - 1) need to be tested.
    .But ...look at the second half?
    .We only need to check for 2 to n/2
    .what about odd n?


Divisor Counting - Even Better?


Primality test
    .Problem statement: Given an integer n. Determine if n is a prime number or not?
        .You already know divisor Counting
        .Take numbers from 2 to 2square
            -if any of them divide n, NOT prime
